# fetch from the db and return the plane models and their icao codes


# create a plane model class


# setup the api calls to https://airlabs.co/api/v9/flights?api_key=28d1a875-c09d-40bb-9725-9472fd0490fc 



# make a function that takes in a plane model and returns the icao code


# take the icao code and make a call to the air labs api and return the data on current flights


# create a function that will take the data and filter out so that it will only return the flights that are in the air by their icao code
